      Hey there!
      <br />
      <br />
      It seems like you're a bit of a hacker, why not <b>join us at the school's 
      Hack Club at Tuesday lunchtime in the Computer Science Lab (E619)</b>? Every meeting,
      we build projects, jam to music, have fun and munch on snacks. At the
      moment, we're building the world's coolest* Christmas tree.
      <br />
      <br />
      Whether you enjoy music, art or coding, we'd love to meet you! Anyone is
      welcome, zero prior experiences needed at all :D <b>Hack Club is a place where
      artists, coders, designers & musicans come together to make amazing things!</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh and BTW, we aren't cracking open bank accounts! That's not what hacking
      means, that's cracking. We're just having fun being creative whilst making
      things.
      <br />
      <br />
      See you there!
      <br />
